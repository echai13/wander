There are many forms of transportation that can get you to the places you want to visit. Here are your options especially when you are a budget traveler.

## Ride-sharing services: Uber vs. Grab

Coming from the US, I already had Uber installed on my phone. So it was handy when we didn't like a price quoted by a tuk tuk driver. Lyft is basically non-existent in Southeast Asia so I suggest removing that useless space-taker and install Grab instead, Southeast Asia's Uber. In fact, Grab was cheaper than Uber most of the time especially in Thailand. For example, it costs 150 baht on Uber while it costs 75 baht on Grab going to the same destination. 

On Grab, you also have the option of paying in cash if you do not want to pay by card. Additionally, by using Grab, you earn points and with the points you can redeem discounts like 10,000 dong off a ride in Vietnam. 

Currently, UberMoto and GrabBike are banned in Thailand due to legal issues. But once the ban is lifted, I suggest trying it out at least once. If not, remember to try it out in Vietnam!
